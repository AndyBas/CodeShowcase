These scripts have been written for a first-person prototype within the context
of the "Seven Days FPS" Game Jam.

I did it on Unreal Engine 5 using C++ to challenge myself.
I'm learning C++ and wanted to test my skills with this project.

The game is about the player trying to escape a Nightmare.
It has different paths it can take, but it has only one right.
Using the Door script I can manipulate which doors are openable and which ones are fake.
